Hi, I'm Rafi! A passionate learner and aspiring software developer enthusiastic about fullstack development and AI integration. My journey covers both frontend and backend technologies, building responsive and dynamic web applications using React (Vite), JavaScript, Spring Boot, and the latest frameworks. I have growing experience in backend tools and concepts, alongside a solid foundation in cybersecurity practices and information security.

I am also expanding my skills in machine learning—exploring data-driven solutions, intelligent systems, and the intersection between AI and software development. Previous projects has given me experience on hands-on practice with Agile methodologies, teamwork, and real-world project delivery.

Always eager to learn, I enjoy integrating cutting-edge tech into my projects, whether it's web apps, secure coding, or leveraging ML models for smarter solutions. Let's build great things together!
